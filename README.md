Test programs to learn Django
==========

This is a test-bed for my Django project, which may evolve into
a fully functional web application.

How to setup
----------

```console
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py createsuperuser
    $ python manage.py runserver

Create user "Teacher" and "Student" for the home application to work.
